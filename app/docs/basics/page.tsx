        A sizable fraction of the theoretical developments in physics of the
        last sixty years would not be understandable without the use of path or,
        more generally, field integrals. In this article we will focus on the
        use of path integrals and field integrals in different branches of
        theoretical physics. A rigorous study of the mathematical properties of
        path and field integrals is an open subtopic of functional analysis and
        will not be dealt with here. Path integrals are given by sum over all
        paths satisfying some boundary conditions and can be understood as
        extensions to an infinite number of integration variables of usual
        multi-dimensional integrals. Path integrals are powerful tools for the
        study of quantum mechanics. Indeed, in quantum mechanics, physical
        quantities can be expressed as averages over all possible paths weighted
        by the exponential of a term proportional to the ratio of the classical
        action  associated to each path, divided by the Planck's constant ℏ .
        Thus, path integrals emphasize very explicitly the correspondence
        between classical and quantum mechanics. In particular, in the
        semi-classical limit /ℏ→∞ , the leading contributions in the average
        come from paths close to classical paths, which are stationary points of
        the action. Thus, path integrals lead to an intuitive understanding and
        simple calculations of physical quantities in the semi-classical limit.
